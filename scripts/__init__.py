	#Scripts Folder

	This is currently an experimental folder...

	
	This folder is for holding programs useful outside of sequences and are
	executed outside of the Labscript Program Suite. This was created to
	hold `mloop_config.py' style files. These files modify the globals.h5
	files, as well as create configuration files for MLOOP to read.

	Other scripts that are useful maybe stored here as well.
