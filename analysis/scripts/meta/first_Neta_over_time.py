''' This metanalysis will plot and analyse the initially loaded Neta versus the time. It
will be used: 
i) to monitor how fitting Rabi splitting works over the time and/or
as a function of experimental parameters
ii) to test the loading efficiency, the output can be used to optimize loading

 # To Do 
 	[x] make atoms_in_cavity_helper.py write the Neta 1 value per scan number of fit in lyse parameters
 	[x] read lyse parameters here
 	[x] drop Neta based on bad chi^2 
 	[] multiple scan number and different color for different scan number in the sequence
 	[] statistics (hist plot, for example) of Neta results
