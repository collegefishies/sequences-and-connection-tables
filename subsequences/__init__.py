'''
This module holds the building blocks of a full experimental sequence, for 
easy re-use.

Please break up functions into smaller files, if you don't want long import strings like
`import labscriptlib.ybclock.subsequences.chis_sequences.load_mot`
add a `from ... import *` in the `__init__.py`. This will load it in the parent module,
i.e., only a `from labscriptlib.ybclock.subsequences import load_mot` is necessary.

Even more compact is 
```
import labscriptlib.ybclock.subsequences as subseq

subseq.load_mot()
```

or
```
from labscriptlib.ybclock.subsequences import *

load_mot()
```

This let's us maintain small python scripts without loss of
simplicity with importing.
