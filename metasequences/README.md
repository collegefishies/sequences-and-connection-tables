#metasequences

A meta-sequence, is a sequence that can be rerun that changes which sequence it runs based on old data. This old data can be stored in old hdf files, or some custom written format.

The only problem with metasequences, is I'm not sure labscript was written with them in mind, so the HDF files will be named after the metasequences file name, rather than the actually ran file.
